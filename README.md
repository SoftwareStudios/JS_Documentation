# JS_Documentation developed in HTML and CSS
## Project Description
This project is an abstract from MDN JavaScript documentation. I wanted to work with a large amount of text (not just Lorem Ipsum) and focus on correct formatting and styling so it's easy to follow and read. I developed this project in HTML and CSS. No JavaScript, yet. Also, I focused on improving my understanding of media queries by implementing them in the project to make the webpage responsive on multiple devices. (yet to be added)

## Difficulties Faced
So far, nothing major. The webpage still needs CSS and media queries. I am sure once I begin adding some style, I will update this section.
