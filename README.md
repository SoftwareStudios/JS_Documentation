# JS_Documentation developed in HTML and CSS
## Project Description
This project is an abstract from MDN JavaScript documentation. I wanted to work with a large amount of text (not just Lorem Ipsum) and focus on correct formatting and styling so it's easy to follow and read. I developed this project in HTML and CSS. No JavaScript, yet. Also, I focused on improving my understanding of media queries by implementing them in the project to make the webpage responsive on multiple devices.

## Difficulties Faced
Got to work with text manipulation and media queries. I am still trying to get my head around all the CSS selectors. WIth a little help from a tutorial on FreeCodeCamp, I managed to get the layout I needed. I was so close to the sample design, but not quite.

## How I tested the webiste
- Firefox developer tools
- HTML validator
